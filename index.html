    <h1>Welcome to My Capstone Website</h1>

    <p>This website was created to identify individuals that make the institution more susceptible to phishing attacks.
    If you clicked the link leading you here please remember to properly verify emails and SMS to ensure they are legitimate.</p>
    <p>Please remember that PHISHING IS BAD!</p>
    <p>These attacks can come from familiar contacts/accounts (their account has likely been compromised) and unfamiliar contacts/accounts.</p> 
    <p>If you ever click a link that has been sent to you act fast by changing your password if possible and making a report of the incident.</p> 
    <p>Phishing attacks may occur via several formats, for example a fake login page, free items being given away, texts about packages not </p>
    <p>being able to be dropped off, and request for monetary info to obtain funds. </p>
    <p>Most importantly, if you receive an email or text that seems sketchy verify its validity with a trusted person before acting on it. </p>
